April 3rd

1. http://127.0.0.1:8000/customer/dilivery-dates/5
Datetime input box has to be given. 
The html is oneshipment.html

2. Delivery Dates page - order by company name to group the items from the same company together.

3. In Delivery Page, once you select the shipment type and click submit, 
   when you click back, it should directly go previous stage (order summary).
   Right now, if you click back, it is going to the page where you select shipment type again.
   Similarly, once shipment type is selected, when customer clicks on proceed to delivery from order summary,
   it should not ask him to select shipment type again.

4. Order Summary Page - Total amount for all the vendors/products should be shown at the end of the page.

5. Instead of putting if photo condition in jinga, add attribute to model field - 'default_pic'.
   If there is no picture, it should take the default picture.

6. In Update modal for Inspection, populate the fields with the existing data. Right now, a empty form is coming up in the modal.

7. Need to ask him on the design of shipment mark generation - what to print is clear but the size, spacing and way to print them needs to be discussed.
   Drawing on pen and paper would give us a good idea.
